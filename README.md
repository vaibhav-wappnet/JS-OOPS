# OOPS concepts with Javascript

This project covers almost all the Topics of Object Oriented Programming with javascript programming language.

## Concepts

* Classes and Objects
* Constructor
* `this` keyword
* Inheritance
  * Multiple Inheritance
  * Multilevel Inheritance
* methods
  * method Overriding
  * getter method `get`
  * setter method `set`
* Encapsulation
  * method overriding
  * method overloading (not supported in Javascript)
* Abstraction
* Polymorphism

# Overview

## Inheritance

An abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users. In other words, it ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one.

The Inheritance folder contains all the programs for how inheritance is achieved in javascript.

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions into one component (for example, a class)

The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must: declare class variables/attributes as private. provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable.

## Abstraction
An abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users. In other words, it ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one.

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming language. Polymorphism means the same function with different signatures is called many times. In real life, for example, a boy at the same time may be a student, class monitor, etc. So a boy can perform different operations at the same time.
